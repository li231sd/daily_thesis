# Daily Thesis

A Flutter app that delivers one relevant research paper a day, picked to match your interests.

On first launch you pick the subjects you care about (Computer Science, Medicine, Biology, Physics, and more). From then on, the app surfaces a matching paper each day — sourced from arXiv and OpenAlex via a Cloudflare Worker backend — with the abstract, a link to the full paper, and tools like citation copying and reading history.

The app is free to use, supported by AdMob ads.

## Tech stack

- **Flutter / Dart** — see `pubspec.yaml` for exact SDK and package versions
- **Backend**: a Cloudflare Worker that queries arXiv and OpenAlex and returns matched papers
- **Local storage**: `shared_preferences` for user profile, subjects, and reading history — no account or server-side user data
- **Ads**: `google_mobile_ads` (AdMob), configured via `.env` (see Setup below)

Ads currently run on Android/iOS only; the app also builds for web and desktop via Flutter's standard multi-platform support.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed and on your `PATH`
- An emulator, simulator, or physical device (`flutter devices` to check what's available)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root (see `.env.example` for the exact keys needed) with your AdMob credentials. The App ID also needs to be set as `com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID` in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — that value is baked in at build time and can't be read from `.env`.

   While developing, use [Google's official test ad unit IDs](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads) instead of real ones to avoid triggering invalid traffic on your AdMob account.

3. Run it:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Building a release APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
Output lands at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

## Project layout

Code follows a standard Flutter convention:
- `lib/screens/` — one file per app screen (onboarding, main paper view, history, settings)
- `lib/services/` — data fetching and local persistence (papers, user profile, ad loading, etc.)
- `lib/widgets/` — reusable UI pieces shared across screens
- `lib/models/` — data classes

For what's actually in each folder today, just look — this list is deliberately not itemized further so it doesn't go stale as files get added.

## Notes for contributors

- `.env` is gitignored — never commit real AdMob IDs. Use `.env.example` as the template.
- Android signing keys (`key.properties`, `*.jks`/`*.keystore`) are also gitignored; keep them out of version control.
